    <h1>Privacy & Consent</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: December 15, 2025</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>SafePDF is built to prioritize privacy. The desktop application and downloadable tools perform PDF processing locally on your device; files are not uploaded to our servers by default.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Free vs Pro / Paid Features</h2>
      <p>The core SafePDF application and many features are provided under an open source GPL‑3.0 license and operate entirely on your device. Some enhanced ("Pro") features may be offered as paid upgrades or subscriptions. When you enable or purchase Pro features we will clearly disclose what data (if any) is required to provide those features.</p>
      <p>By default, purchases are processed via third‑party payment providers. The Provider does not store raw payment card data. If any Pro feature requires optional cloud sync or remote processing, such behavior will be described before purchase and require your explicit consent.</p>

      <h2>Information We May Collect</h2>
      <p>We aim to minimize data collection. Depending on how you use the website or services, we may process:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> anonymized analytics about website usage (if you opt in).</li>
        <li><strong>Contact details:</strong> information you provide when contacting support (name, email, message).</li>
        <li><strong>Crash reports / logs:</strong> optionally shared diagnostic data when explicitly enabled by you.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not collect or transmit file contents or PDF metadata from files you process locally unless you explicitly upload files to a service that requests them.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Cookies and Tracking</h2>
      <p>Our site uses a cookie banner to request consent for optional cookies. Necessary cookies required for the site's basic UI are always enabled. Optional cookies (analytics and marketing) are only used after you provide consent and can be changed at any time using the Cookie Settings.</p>
      <p>Cookie preferences are stored locally in your browser (using `localStorage`) and are not transmitted to us.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Legal Basis</h2>
      <p>Where applicable (for visitors in jurisdictions like the EU), we rely on your consent for optional analytics and marketing cookies. Processing necessary for site functionality does not require consent.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Third‑Party Services</h2>
      <p>We may link to or reference third‑party services (e.g., GitHub). Those services have their own privacy practices; we encourage you to review their policies.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Retention</h2>
      <p>We retain contact messages and opt‑in analytics data only as long as necessary to provide support and to improve the product. If you request deletion, we will remove your contact data from our records where possible.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Your Rights</h2>
      <p>You may request access, correction, or deletion of personal data you provided (for example, contact form messages). To exercise these rights, contact the maintainer via the project repository.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>We apply reasonable administrative and technical safeguards to protect stored data. However, no online system is completely secure — please avoid sending sensitive information via public forms.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Contact</h2>
      <p>Questions about privacy practices can be directed to the project maintainer: <a href="https://github.com/mcagriaksoy/SafePDF">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
