PyPDF2>=3.0.0

# Image processing and PDF rendering (no external dependencies)

# Notes:
# - `tkinter` is part of the Python standard library (ensure your Python build includes Tk)
# - pypdfium2 includes all necessary binaries for PDF rendering (no Poppler needed)
# - The codebase attempts to import `PyPDF2` first then `pypdf` as a fallback; include either one in your environment.
# - Install with: pip install -r requirements.txt
