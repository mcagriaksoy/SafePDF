SafePDF Help (English)

Overview:
SafePDF is a lightweight desktop application to perform common PDF operations locally on your computer, without sending files to any server.

Supported operations:
- Compress: Reduce PDF file size by re-encoding images and optimizing content streams.
- Split: Split a PDF into single-page PDFs or specified page ranges.
- Merge: Combine multiple PDF files into one (multi-file merge support planned).
- PDF to JPG: Convert each PDF page to a JPEG image.
- Rotate: Rotate pages by 90, 180, or 270 degrees.
- Repair: Attempt to recover readable pages from a corrupted PDF.

How to use:
1) Select a PDF file: Use Drag & Drop onto the main area or click "Load File from Disk".
2) Choose operation: Select the operation from the Operations screen.
3) Adjust settings: Fine-tune options such as compression quality, output location, DPI for images, or page ranges.
4) Execute: Click Execute on the Settings screen and monitor progress.
5) Save results: Use Save to store the output file or folder to another location.

Tips & best practices:
- For best compression results, use the "High" quality only when you need good image fidelity; "Medium" is recommended.
- Very small PDFs or already-optimized files may not compress further.
- Use the "Microsoft Print to PDF" option for alternative re-encoding on Windows if compression fails.

Canceling operations:
- Click the Cancel button during an operation to request cancellation. A double confirmation is required to avoid accidental stops.

Troubleshooting:
- If an operation does not start, verify that PyPDF2/pypdf and PyMuPDF/Pillow are installed.
- For PDF->Image conversion, PyMuPDF (PyMuPDF/Fitz) provides better quality and speed. If not installed, conversion will try to use Pillow where possible.
- If the UI freezes, try closing the app and running again. Report reproducible issues including sample files if possible.

Localization:
- This help content is stored in `help_content.txt` and is ready to be replaced with other languages. Place localized files like `help_content_tr.txt` next to this file and the app can be adapted to load them based on user language.
