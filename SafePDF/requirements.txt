# SafePDF Tkinter Application Requirements

# Core PDF manipulation
# Image processing and PDF to image conversion
# Drag and drop support (optional)
# Standard libraries (included with Python)
PyPDF2>=3.0.0
# Image processing and PDF to image conversion
Pillow>=9.0.0
PyMuPDF>=1.20.0

# Optional - provides drag & drop support in the UI
tkinterdnd2>=0.3.0

# Notes:
# - `tkinter` is part of the Python standard library (ensure your Python build includes Tk)
# - The codebase attempts to import `PyPDF2` first then `pypdf` as a fallback; include either one in your environment.
# - Install with: pip install -r requirements.txt
